    The online bookstore delivery apps allow the book store owners and authors to sell or rent their books to people interested in reading them in return for money. Today, people are so dependent on mobile apps that they don’t like to step out of their houses and book everything online. Same way, they head to an online bookstore marketplace every time they want to purchase or rent a book. With these online marketplaces for books, the app users just need to register themselves on these apps and search for the genre of books they’re interested in reading.
